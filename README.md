# Flask-Framework-From-Beginning
I will show the beginner how to use flask framework and some coolest way to do a project using python-flask.

## 1st download python and pip 

## My operating system is Windows

### Then We have to make a virtual Environment for our Project.

    mkdir flaskenv
    
    cd flaskenv
    
    virtualenv venv
    
    cd venv/Scripts/
    
    activate
    
 ## By activating command, Virtual Environment will be run. If you want to disable it, just use <b>deactivate</b> command.
